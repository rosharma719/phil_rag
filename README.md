# **Philosophy RAG!**

A structured way to explore philosophy by mapping the logical and semantic connections between ideas. Users enter ideas they want to explore more, and the system cross-references them to synthesize insights and suggest related ideas to prompt further discussion. Over time, this builds an interactive belief graph, enabling deeper philosophical exploration.
