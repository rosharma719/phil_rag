# **Philosophy RAG!**

A structured way to explore philosophy by mapping the logical and semantic connections between ideas. Users enter ideas they want to explore more, and the system cross-references them to synthesize insights and suggest related ideas to prompt further discussion. Over time, this builds an interactive belief graph, enabling deeper philosophical exploration.

Dependencies might need to be manually installed.

This project uses Neon for full-document storage, Pinecone for vector search, and Neo4j for graph traversal and relationship storage.
